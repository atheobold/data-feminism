*Data Feminism* is a course that explores relationships among data, power, and justice through feminist theory. Throughout our time together we will examine
how oppression shapes data practices and learn feminist strategies for 
recognizing bias, critiquing inequities, and designing ethical, justice-oriented
approaches to data collection and analysis.

We're going to have a lot of fun!
