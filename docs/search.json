Missing assignments will be scaled, so that if for example you miss four reading annotations your grade will decrease by one third of a step (a B to a B-). If you miss four reading annotations and you turn the first draft of your data context protocol late your grade will decrease by two thirds of a step (a B to a C+).\nGrade Boosters\nYou can increase your letter grade by up to a third of a step (for example a B to B+) for every two community labor points. For example, to earn an A in this class you must meet the conditions for a B and earn six community labor points.\nAny deviation from the grading policies outlined above will only be to your benefit."
