On Canvas you can find a detailed description of the major and minor learning goals, how you can demonstrate your proficiency, and what is required for particular course grades.\nNote that the portfolio is not simply a list of links to your code; it also requires a brief discussion of how that code demonstrates the skill.

That is to say, although you will not necessarily need to write code, the portfolio will take a good amount of time and effort to assemble; plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionIncremental Progress\n\n\n\nYou can do your future self a big favor by working on your portfolio progressively throughout the quarter, instead of leaving it all for Finals Week.

If you are registered with DRC to have deadline extensions, you are required to complete a deadline extension request and make a note if your extension is related to a need related to DRC accommodations.\nAny late work is required to have a deadline extension request, meaning if you do not complete a deadline extension request for an assignment you are not permitted to turn it in late.

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and open-minded.\nSome examples of how to be a good classmate include:\n\nDoing your best to avoid language that is ableist, racist, sexist, or classist; or that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\nAddressing your classmates by their preferred name and pronouns.\nDoing your best to be aware of your own biases, privileges, and areas of ignorance.\nListening to others’ opinions, and making an effort to understand their perspective.\nTaking the time to help your classmates grasp concepts or solve problems, even when you are ready to move on.\n\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

To earn credit for the course reading, you will be expected to post three quality* annotations per assignment to Perusall.\nA quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed by Tuesday at 9am to receive credit."
