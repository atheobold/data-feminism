    "text": "Final Gathering\n“I was going to die, if not sooner than later, whether or not I had ever spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you.\nWhat are the words you do not have yet? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken and die of them, still in silence? We have been socialized to respect fear more than our own need for language.\nAnd, of course, I am afraid—you can hear it in my voice—because the transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self-revelation and that always seems fraught with danger. But my daughter, when I told her of our topic and my difficulty with it, said, “tell them about how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent, because there’s always that one little piece inside of you that wants to be spoken out, and if you keep ignoring it, it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter, and if you don’t speak it out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth.\nI began to ask each time: “What’s the worst that could happen to me if I tell this truth?” Unlike women in other countries, our breaking silence is unlikely to have us jailed, “disappeared” or run off the road at night. Our speaking out will irritate some people, get us called bitchy or hypersensitive and disrupt some dinner parties. And then our speaking out will permit other women to speak, until laws are changed and lives are saved and the world is altered forever.\nNext time, ask: What’s the worst that will happen? Then push yourself a little further than you dare. Once you start to speak, people will yell at you. They will interrupt you, put you down and suggest it’s personal. And the world won’t end.\nAnd the speaking will get easier and easier. And you will find you have fallen in love with your own vision, which you may never have realized you had. And you will lose some friends and lovers, and realize you don’t miss them. And new ones will find you and cherish you. And at last you’ll know with surpassing certainty that only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.”\nAudre Lorde, Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet"

This is designed to give flexibility and freedom to explore while ensuring a level of accountability.\nYou are guaranteed a grade of a B for this class if you meet the following conditions:\nGrade Calculations\nYour grade will decrease by a third of a step (for example a B to a B-) for each B condition that you do not meet. Missing assignments will be scaled, so that if for example you miss four reading annotations your grade will decrease by one third of a step (a B to a B-). Similarly, if you miss two class meetings, your grade will decrease by one third of a step (a B to a B-). If you miss four reading annotations and you miss two class meetings your grade will decrease by two thirds of a step (a B to a C+).\nGrade Boosters\nYou can increase your letter grade by up to a third of a step (for example a B to B+) for every two community labor points. For example, to earn an A in this class you must meet the conditions for a B and earn six community labor points.\nAny deviation from the grading policies outlined above will only be to your benefit."

If you have one of these questions, please post your question on our course Discord server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteResponding to Private Messages\n\n\n\nIf you send my a DM on Discord asking a question that I believe other students would benefit from seeing my response, I will likely choose to answer it in one of the public channels of Discord instead. Please don’t take this personally! It just means that you asked a good question, and I think the rest of the class could benefit from seeing the answer.\n\n\n\n\nI enthusiastically support the mission of Disability Resource Center to make education accessible to all. I design all my courses with accessibility at the forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let’s talk to each other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal processes.\n\n\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.\n\n\nNational surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly are here to help you. Cal Poly’s Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Canvas, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to dating violence and stalking.\n\n\nIf you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know."
