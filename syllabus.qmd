# Class meetings

**Room:** Building 10, Room 126

**Times:** Tuesdays from 12:10pm - 2:00pm

# Student Hours {#sec-OH}

This quarter I will be holding student hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, 
and Thursdays at the same time---so it is easy to remember!

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Day             | Time                                             |
+=================+==================================================+
| Mondays         | 12:10pm -- 1:00pm (in-person)                    |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Wednesdays      | 12:10pm -- 1:00pm (in-person)                    |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Thursdays       | 12:10 pm - 1:00 pm (on Zoom)                     |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

I will typically hold student hours in my office (25-105), but may choose to
move to the outside vestibule between wings of the building (where all the
whiteboards are) or the Statistics department conference room. If we're meeting
somewhere other than my office, I will leave a sign on the door indicating where
we're meeting!

# Personal Meetings 

If you would like to talk with me one-on-one about anything (e.g., grades,
research), I've reserved time on Thursdays from 12:10pm to 1:00pm
for individual appointments. You can make 10-minute appointments through the
following link: <https://calendly.com/allisontheobold>

I do request that you make appointments at least 2-hours ahead of time, so I
don't accidentally miss our meeting!

If you need to meet, but none of the student hours work for you please let me
know! It is possible we can communicate asynchronously through Discord or email,
but I am happy to schedule a meeting during another time if necessary.

# Course Texts

This course follows *Data Feminism* by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. 
You can access every chapter online (<https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/>)
or you can choose to purchase the physical copy of the book through [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262044004/data-feminism/) (please don't 
purchase from Amazon!). 

In addition to this book, we will draw on many books and academic papers. 
I will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed 
through our course Canvas page.

# Infrastructure

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Canvas 

Canvas will be your resource for the course materials necessary for each week.
Each module will walk you through what you are expected to do each week, 
including:

- chapters to read
- reading annotations
- group book presentations
- group final projects


:::{.callout-tip}
Make sure you are receiving email notifications for, at least, announcements
and emails. In Canvas, click on your name, then Notifications. Check that Canvas
is using an email address that you regularly check; you have the option of
registering a mobile number. Check the boxes to get notifications for
announcements, and optionally other Canvas activity.
:::

## Perusall

All course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You 
can access Perusall via our course Canvas page.

## Discord

This quarter, we will make use of a class-wide Discord Server. The link on
Canvas will help you join this server. Refer to the Using Discord guide on
Canvas for more information on how to effectively use this server.

Joining the Discord is not optional. Discord is the primary avenue for earning
community labor points by initiating conversations, responding to conversations, 
or answering course questions. 


:::{.callout-tip}
Discord is also the best way to possibly get your questions answered outside of
ordinary class and office hours.

## Course Description

Explores relationships among data, power, and justice through feminist theory. 
Students examine how oppression shapes data practices and learn feminist 
strategies for recognizing bias, critiquing inequities, and designing ethical,
justice-oriented approaches to data collection and analysis.

## Course Objectives

After taking this course, you will be able to:

1. Describe feminism as a critical theoretical framework for understanding
systems of power and oppression.

2. Discuss how feminist theoretical principles can be used to understand the
power dynamics underlying data practices.

3. Operationalize a feminist lens to:

- Identify how data collection practices and analyses can uphold systemic
biases.
- Explain why data collection practices and analysis could harm groups of
individuals.
- Illustrate how various historical events influence how data are
collected / represented today.

4. Develop a protocol for assessing the historical, material, and ethical
contexts of a dataset. 

5. Apply said protocol to critique a data collection or analysis plan from a
justice-oriented lens.

::: {.callout-note}
# How will these be assessed?

Learning Objective (LO) #1 and #2 will be assessed by weekly reading annotations
and performance in classroom discussions.

LO #3 will be assessed by book presentations in Week 7. 

LO #4 and #5 will be evaluated by the development of a data context protocol
and the application of the protocol to critique the data collection or analysis
of one of the provided datasets. 
:::

# Assessment {#sec-grades}

In this class we will be using a [contract grading system](assignments.qmd). 
This is designed to give flexibility and freedom to explore while ensuring a
level of accountability.

There will be four different types of assignments in this course---reading 
annotations, group book presentations, group data context protocol, and 
community labor. You can read more about each specific assignment type
[here](assignments.qmd). 

## Topics

The course will roughly follow the sequence of topics in *Data Feminism*,
focusing on the following principles:

![](images/principles-of-data-feminism.png){fig-alt="A graphic displaying the 7 principles of Data Feminism. The principles are: examine power, challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible."}

# Classroom Community and Policies

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Preparation

This is a 2-credit course with 2 hours per week of in-classroom instructions.
Cal Poly expects students to devote 4 out-of-class hours per week to 2-credit
classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings
with this target in mind.

## Attendance

Attending class is not only important for your learning but also an act of
community. Many course assignments will be completed in-class, and many critical
thinking skills will be honed in class.

Attendance will be taken in the first 10-minutes of each class. You may miss
one class with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent,
but you should let your group members know. After the second unexcused absence,
your grade may drop by one third of a unit (as specified by the grade contract).
Students arriving more than 10-minutes late for class without having informed me
ahead of time will be marked as absent.

If you must miss a class entirely, you should review the class notes posted to 
the ` #class-notes` channel on Discord. 

## Extensions

I understand that you will sometimes need to prioritize other things over 
meeting assignment deadlines (e.g. your health, wellness, families, communities,
jobs, other coursework). However, there are a number of reasons that I find
enforcing deadlines to be supportive of student learning in this course:

- First, one of the key aims of assignments in this course is to support you in 
learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because
of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in
order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these 
environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if
the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester.

- Second, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also
want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to
incorporate it into future assignments.

There is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no
penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and
you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can
also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you
*make that request at least 24-hours before the original assignment due date*. 
You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on 
Canvas, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. 

**All** deadline extensions must be done through the form, so I can keep track
of who has used their allotment of extensions. If you are registered with DRC to
have deadline extensions, you are required to complete a deadline extension 
request and make a note if your extension is related to a need related to DRC
accommodations.

Any late work is required to have a deadline extension request, meaning if you 
do not complete a deadline extension request for an assignment you **are not** 
permitted to turn it in late. The link to the deadline extension form can be
found in Canvas in the Course Information module (at the top of the page).

::: callout-warning
# This policy does not apply to reading assignments / Perusall annotations

Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date
for credit.
:::

## Academic Honesty

Cal Poly expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of 
academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of
course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Cal Poly are part of an
academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on 
scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and
honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or
plagiarism will be reported to the office of Students Rights and Responsibility.
Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:

- Submitting work completed by another student as your own.
- Copying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.
- Paraphrasing material from another source without citing the author.
- Failing to cite your sources correctly.
- Paying another student or service to complete assignments for you.

For reasons we will discuss in the course, this course takes a strict **no AI**
policy. The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini,
Microsoft Copilot, Claude, etc.) is strictly prohibited. All assignments,
essays, and other submitted work must be your original, independent creation. 
Submitting AI-generated work will be considered a violation of the Cal Poly
Academic Integrity Policy. Such violations will be treated as plagiarism and may
result in a failing grade for the assignment or the course.  

## Participation

Active participation in this course is generally expected and encouraged. That
said, we all have off-days---be it from illness, sadness, heartbreak, or 
exhaustion. I too will have off-days where my words just don’t seem to cohere, 
or my brain will feel jumbled. Because of this, I’ve provided a number of ways
to demonstrate engagement throughout the semester.

## Readings 

I have put a lot of thought into the assigned readings for this course---aiming
to select pieces that are relevant, engaging, challenging, accessible, and
represent a diverse set of voices. Our classroom discussions will be much
richer, more meaningful, and fun when all students come to class having
completed and annotated assigned course readings. While I know that reading may
seem like a low priority when you have impending assignments that you need to
physically hand-in, I encourage you not to wait until the last minute to
complete course readings. You will get the most out of the content if you give
yourself time to digest and reflect on it.

If you are struggling to keep up with the readings, please reach out to me. I’m
more than happy to talk through effective reading strategies and to provide more
guidance on what I’d like you to get out of a specific piece.

# Community 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code of Conduct

As the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in
this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use
of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks,
trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

As the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop
behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not
follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of
abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting the instructor.

All students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct
in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the 
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.0.0, 
available [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct/).

## Principles of Community

Following Ihab Hassan, I strive to teach statistics so that people will stop
killing each other. In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a
sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically
and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. **Everyone
here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the
course.** Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion
in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. **So that everyone
feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each
other and treat each other with respect.** Any attitude or belief that espouses
the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my
classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that
we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other
(and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).

In this classroom, I expect you to be polite, respectful, inclusive, and
open-minded.

Some examples of how to be a good classmate include:

- Check-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. "What three words
describe how you’re feeling?" "Name one challenge and one success from this
week." "What are you doing for self-care right now?" Thank each other for
sharing where they’re at.
- Consider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating
space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to
community-building as speaking.
- Acknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues
experience the world, but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social
group you perceive them to be a part of.
- Cheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the
first time.
- Ask questions often in our weekly `#questions` channel. Help each other out by
answering questions when you can.
- Mistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and
then move on.

## Pronouns

Using the proper pronouns for everyone is foundational to a safe, respectful
classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on
pronouns and usage, please see the Division of Student Affairs link here: 
[Pronouns](https://sogie.calpoly.edu/PronounsMatter)

## Support {#sec-support}

## Getting Help 

This quarter, I am instating a policy that **I do not respond to emails with
questions of general interest**, such as deadline clarifications or conceptual
questions. If you have one of these questions, please post your question on our
course Discord server. 

::: {.callout-note}
# Responding to Private Messages

If you send my a DM on Discord asking a question that I believe other students
would benefit from seeing my response, I will likely choose to answer it in
one of the public channels of Discord instead. Please don't take this
personally! It just means that you asked a good question, and I think the rest
of the class could benefit from seeing the answer.
:::

## Accommodations

I enthusiastically support the mission of Disability Resource Center to make
education accessible to all. I design all my courses with accessibility at the
forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make
things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need
accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let's talk to each
other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the
standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal
processes.

## Financial Resources

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat
every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this
may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of
Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in
doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other
campus resources.

## Mental Health

National surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep
problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant
other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic
performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly
are here to help you. Cal Poly's Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free
and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.

## Trigger Warnings

A trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional
response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will
do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I
can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous
form, available on Canvas, where you can indicate topics for which you would
like me to provide a warning.

## Threatening Behavior

I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get
the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to
dating violence and stalking.

## Childcare

If you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring
children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks
to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating
parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know.
