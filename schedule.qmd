## Final Gathering

*"I was going to die, if not sooner than later, whether or not I had ever spoken
myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you.*

*What are the words you do not have yet? What do you need to say? What are the
tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will
sicken and die of them, still in silence? We have been socialized to respect
fear more than our own need for language.*

*And, of course, I am afraid---you can hear it in my voice---because the
transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self-revelation
and that always seems fraught with danger. But my daughter, when I told her of
our topic and my difficulty with it, said, "tell them about how you’re never
really a whole person if you remain silent, because there’s always that one
little piece inside of you that wants to be spoken out, and if you keep ignoring
it, it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter, and if you don’t speak it
out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth.*

*I began to ask each time: "What’s the worst that could happen to me if I tell
this truth?" Unlike women in other countries, our breaking silence is unlikely
to have us jailed, "disappeared" or run off the road at night. Our speaking out
will irritate some people, get us called bitchy or hypersensitive and disrupt
some dinner parties. And then our speaking out will permit other women to speak,
until laws are changed and lives are saved and the world is altered forever.*

*Next time, ask: What’s the worst that will happen? Then push yourself a little
further than you dare. Once you start to speak, people will yell at you. They 
will interrupt you, put you down and suggest it’s personal. And the world won’t 
end.*

*And the speaking will get easier and easier. And you will find you have fallen
in love with your own vision, which you may never have realized you had. And you 
will lose some friends and lovers, and realize you don’t miss them. And new ones
will find you and cherish you. And at last you’ll know with surpassing certainty
that only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.”*
