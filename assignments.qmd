title: "Assignments"

In the sections below I provide more detail regarding the different 
types of assignments you will be completing throughout the course. 

# Reading Annotations

Each week a selection of course readings will be posted as an assignment on
Perusall--a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To
earn credit for the course reading, you will be expected to post three quality*
annotations per assignment to Perusall. 

A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask
thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found 
that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s
annotations. **Annotations must be completed by Tuesday at 9am to receive credit.**

::: {.callout-note}
A single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit three
annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.

# Book Presentations

In addition to the readings each week, you will be required to read 20-30 pages
(1-2 chapters) from one of the following books:

- [Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Noble](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/)
- [Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez](https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/)
- [Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology)
- [The Transgender Issue by Shon Faye](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/315349/the-transgender-issue-by-faye-shon/9780141991801)

By Week 5 you will need to choose which book you plan to read. That week Dr. 
Theobold will assemble student groups interested in each book. From there, your
group will be responsible for deciding who will read which chapters, with the 
expectation of everyone reading 1-2 chapters. 

In Week 7, each group will provide a 15-minute presentation on the central ideas
from the book they read. 

# Data Context Protocol

In the final three weeks of the course, you will form groups and develop a 
"data analysis protocol" for assessing the historical, material, and ethical
contexts of a dataset. You will also apply your protocol to critique the context
of one of the provided datasets. 

- In Week 8 you will form groups of 3-4 students and begin writing your data
analysis protocol. 

- In Week 9 your group will submit the first draft of your data analysis
protocol.
    * Dr. Theobold and another student group will provide feedback on your first
    draft!

- In Week 10 your group will submit the second draft of your data analysis
protocol. 
    * Dr. Theobold will provide one final round of feedback on this draft. 

- During finals week your group will present your data analysis protocol and 
an example of how you applied your protocol to one of the provided datasets 
(posted to Canvas). 

# Community Labor

Ethnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and
interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative
community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining
strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an
effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to 
contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are three
opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. 

## Contributing on Discord 

The first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in
one of the weekly #discussion channels on the course Discord server. For
**every conversation that you initiate** in this channel, you will earn 
**1 community labor point**. For **every conversation that you respond to** in
this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 
**1 community labor point.**

Finally, **for every question that you answer** in the weekly #questions
channels on the course Discord server, you will earn **1 community labor point**.

## Contributing Class Notes

Following a class period, up to two (possibly more) students may type up a
1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that
outline in the #class-notes channel of the course Discord server. You can
sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should 
be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not
present in class. 

**Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor
points.**

## Peer Review

During Week 9, you will receive the data analysis protocol written by
*at least one* other group. You will be tasked with providing thoughtful and
constructive comments on how their protocol could be improved. 

**Each peer review you complete will count for 2 community labor points.**
