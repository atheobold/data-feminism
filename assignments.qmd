# Reading Annotations

Each week a selection of course readings will be posted as an assignment on
Perusall--a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To
earn credit for the course reading, you will be expected to post three quality* annotations per assignment to Perusall. 

A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask
thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found 
that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s
annotations. **Annotations must be completed by Tuesday at 9am to receive credit.**

A single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit three
annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.

# Community Labor

Ethnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are three opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. 

<!-- Contributing on Slack -->
<!-- The first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. -->

## Contributing Class Notes

<!-- Following a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of  -->
<!-- what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in -->
<!-- #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain -->
<!-- class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make  -->
<!-- sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you 
<!-- contribute will count for 2 community labor points. -->

## Participating in Peer Review Workshops

<!-- Peer review for the data collection protocol drafts -->

<!-- Throughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.  -->
